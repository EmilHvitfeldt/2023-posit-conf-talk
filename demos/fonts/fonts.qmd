title: Let's test typst font support
format: typst
keep-typ: true

::: {}

```{=typst}
#set text(font: (
  "Papyrus",
  "Noto Sans Arabic",
))
```

Blue, and with long ears. \
هذا عربي.

Note the ligature rendering on the Arabic font!

If your code has some fancy equations, this comes up as well. This is a constant source of trouble in Julia code:

```{{julia}}
# from https://nextjournal.com/jperkel/julia-on-nextjournal
r = 5; # radius of a circle
A = π * r^2;
C = 2 * π * r;
```
